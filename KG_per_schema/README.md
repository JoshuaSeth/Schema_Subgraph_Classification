Folder for creating a knowledge graph per schema and noting some structural metrics about these knowledge graphs and intuitively analyzing them. This should probably give a lot of information since it brings us close to the final use-case. Hopefully this information can help in deciding the **schema** (mechanic, scierc, self-made, combination), **output structure** (triples, multiple triples, queries, subgraphs) and **modelling** (N-ary, hypperrelational, subgraph, plain triples) of the KG in our research.

## Proposed Architecture

- Merge all sentences to single dataset (once)
- Create dataset in appropriate format
- Create prediction sets
- 
- Render with Streamlit + AGraph
-
