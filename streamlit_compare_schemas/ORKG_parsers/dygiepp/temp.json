1: Since the disease is often silent , there is a need to raise awareness among the general population on how to avoid infection and to encourage high-risk groups to be tested .
2: It is evident that there is an urgent need to establish animal models which authentically recapitulate human lung disease which will be important for understanding disease pathogenesis .
3: Given the limitations and paucity of previous research associated with emergency behaviour , the present findings are promising as we seek to establish a new way of studying this area .
4: Therefore , anti-adhesive drugs that prevent the adhesion of pathogens to host tissues may offer a novel strategy to fight infectious diseases89 .
5: However , the quantitative approach may improve de-escalation of antibiotics by targeting the specific pathogens that are causing VAP .
6: Before embarking in complex combination studies , it is important to further investigate the role that existing vaccines could have against resistant infections .}
