{'coref': {'loss': 0}, 'relation': {'loss': 0}, 'ner': {'loss': 0}, 'events': {'loss': 0}, 'loss': tensor(0.), 'metadata': 0: The irrigation system of Pakistan has been considered one of the largest contagious systems of the world by Gachal et al. 2007 .
1: We had two main concerns regarding phosphate displacement .
2: The first was mechanical   as the virus gets smaller , the membrane curves more per unit area .
3: This is necessary for all countries regardless of their wealth .
4: During the SARS outbreak in 2002 , the only facility equipped with diagnostic equipment in Singapore was Tan Tock Seng hospital and people were sent there , thus increasing the chance of spreading this disease during their transportation .
5: Across these reviews , the most effective interventions were those that specifically targeted social isolated or lonely individuals , had a sound theoretical basis , used a multi-leveled approach , and involved active engagement of the participant .
6: There were inconsistent findings regarding greater effectiveness for group compared to one-on-one interventions .
7: Individual reviews highlighted particular effectiveness of psychoeducational approaches and social skills training,88 , 89 the need to better understand mechanisms such as maladaptive thinking underlying SIL90 , 91 and the need to incorporate and evaluate technology in future interventions.89
8: PPE-related skin injuries , initially highlighted through case reports 5 , have now been established as a serious consequence of managing this pandemic .
9: Indeed , a recent large multi-centre , cross-sectional survey in China revealed an overall prevalence of skin injuries estimated at 42.8 .
10: This included medical device-related pressure ulcers , representing the most common form of damage , moisture associated skin dermatitis and skin tears .
11: Plague , is a zoonotic infection caused by Yersinia pestis , which occurs in the western United States with regularity and has an animal reservoir Bennett et al. , 2015 .
12: The situation with the naturally occurring Yersinia is in contrast to the appearance of a case of smallpox which would raise an immediate red flag for a bioterrorist event .
13: Physical or emotional separation from parents also can be interpreted as withdrawal of love , abandonment , punishment , or rejection .
14: Diminished attention from parents can lead to jealousy .
15: This can be expressed in statements such as , My parents pay less attention to me because they love me less 1 . Ebola spreads through direct contact with body fluids blood , saliva , mucus , vomit , faeces , sweat , tears , breast milk , urine , semen of persons who developed symptoms of the disease .
16: Zoonosis notably involving bats and primates played a role as well .
17: The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa from December 2013 to January 2016 , claiming a death toll of more than 11,000 victims while nightmare scenarios forecasted millions of deaths .
18: The demonstration of a functional bat immune system in NSG mice recipient holds a fundamental importance for the potential utility of this model .
19: To investigate if bat-mice have a functional immune system , 24-week old bat-mice that were generated by injecting 1   105 BM cells during their neonatal stage Fig. 4a were immunized with 4-Hydroxy-3-Nitrophenylacetyl hapten conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin NP-KLH using incomplete Freunds adjuvant IFA as an adjuvant to determine whether antigen-specific adaptive immune responses can be achieved in bat-mice .
20: The proposed conceptualisation in this paper provides an extended context for the discussion of overtourism .
21: Importantly , it suggests that to ignore resident stress responses is equal to accepting more violent forms of anti-tourism sentiment in the longer term .
22: While the paper thus confirms some of the place-person interrelationships outlined by McKercher et al. 2015 or Steen Jacobsen et al. 2019 , it also highlights social psychological complexities , and the importance of considering responses to overtourism as emotionally accentuated outcomes of changes in place perceptions .
23: Some have suggested it is related to the long course of the left recurrent laryngeal , which extends down into the chest and loops under the arch of the aorta to return to the larynx , but this hypothesis is weakened by the fact that the axonal injury is distal to where the nerve innervates the larynx .
24: Curiously , studies have shown that other long nerves in the horse can also show degenerative changes , which may indicate that this disorder is a polyneuropathy , rather than a specific disease of the recurrent laryngeal nerve .
25: In summary , this is the first imaging documentation of microvascular thrombosis in living severe COVID-19 patients since the beginning of the hospitalization .
26: The clinical relevance of microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 requires further research .
27: A key advantage provided by NGS in genomics is the capacity to detect low-frequency variants 15 , which are important elements in both genetic and infectious diseases research 16 see NGS to study rapidly mutating viruses below .
28: NGS analyses have also revealed complex scenarios , with somatic gene rearrangements in host tissues or cells being far more common than expected , and copy number variations accounting for more variation between individuals than the many recognized single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs 12 .
29: As a remarkable example , a comprehensive whole genome analysis revealed a catastrophic event   termed chromotripsis   occurring in at least 23 of all human cancers , whereby tens to hundreds of somatic genomic rearrangements occur with many genomic segments from distinct chromosomes reassembled in random order into a derivative chromosome 17 .Box
30: 3Technical review of data analysis approachesAnalysis of NGS data generally requires a pipeline of bioinformatics tools , which serve a variety of purposes , including technical error correction , quality control of the data output , and ad hoc analyses relevant to specific NGS applications e.g. , variant detection , transcriptome analyses , and epigenetics .
31: It is possible that standard COVID laboratory tests , and particularly D-Dimer , should be routinely drawn among persons under investigation and COVID-positive patients preoperatively and at delivery , with additional hemorrhage precautions taken in patients with unexpectedly abnormal values .
32: However , future studies are needed to answer these questions .
33: The knowledge we gain will further inform the management of COVID-positive pregnancies and , in this case , the intersection between COVID19 and cesarean sections .
34: These mechanisms likely led to the spongy change status spongiosus characteristic of the disease microscopically .
35: Because astrocytes play an important role in regulating fluid and electrolyte balances in the CNS and are the primary cell type having lesions Alzheimers type II astrocytes in hepatic encephalopathy , it is not surprising that alterations in osmoregulation are a component of the pathogenesis of the disease .
36: Astrocytes also contain high concentrations of glutamine synthetase , an enzyme that breaks ammonia into glutamine .
37: Importantly , lower platelets counts , increased levels of fibrin degradation products known as D-dimers44 and coagulation abnormalities are being increasingly associated with poor prognosis and could represent a main cause of organ failure and death in patients with severe COVID-19 ref.45 Fig.
38: Microthrombi of the lungs , lower limbs , hands , brain46 , heart , liver and kidneys47 have been described in patients with COVID-19 .
39: Phosphorylation by MLCK activates non-muscle myosin II light chain , indicating that a functional actomyosin network might be essential for DYNA-IND entry of IAV .}
