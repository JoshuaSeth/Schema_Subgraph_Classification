1: On the other hand , for sparse graphs a well-chosen initial single-qubit chain such as in SPMM can enable short connections to neighboring chains , reducing the qubit footprint of a semi-valid embedding created after the first phase of MinorMiner .
2: We plan to continue extending the approach discussed in this paper and mitigate the mentioned issues .
3: We would like to extend the range of available actions in order to allow the policy to add or remove more virtual machines at once .
4: Furthermore , we aim to modify the system to introduce a continuous policy improvement loop .
5: According to above analysis , cyclopropylamine is suggested to participate in the Xenobiotics Biodegradation Metabolism , which was the 1st-order predicted class for cyclopropylamine by our method .
6: Accordingly , it is quite reasonable to expect that our method may provide useful information for further investigating into biological functions of compounds from the viewpoint of system biology .
7: It appeared that serum levels of sE-selectin are associated with the clinical course of liver metastases from breast cancer .
8: Eichbaum et al. 2004 observed a possible trend for certain unfavorable prognostic parameters e.g. , young women , low-graded tumors , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 over-expression that could be related to higher serum levels of sE-selectin .
9: Moore et al. recently suggested the use of tissue plasminogen activator tPA to treat ARDS in COVID-19 75 .
10: In addition , tackling the systemic prothrombotic complication using anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-IL6R tocilizumab or sarilumab , or the anti-IL6 antibody siltuximab or complement inhibiting strategies to prevent macro- and microthrombi represents another potential approach and several trials are currently verifying this hypothesis 54 .
11: Effective hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be another target to improve the matching of regional perfusion and ventilation in the lung .
12: The proposed emergency needle cricothyrotomy device performed very well .
13: Further work will be pursued in the future with in-vitro and in-vivo with canine models demonstrates the capabilities of the ENCD .
14: Degradation of essential factors for the IFN response can also be achieved by viruses through subversion of ubiquitin pathways that mark a protein for proteosomal degradation by attachment of K48 polyubiquitin chains .
15: In this respect , the STATs appear to be once more attractive targets for viral proteins to direct to proteosomal degradation .
16: Therefore , if the results seen here were due exclusively to innate immunity , we would have expected to see a greater effect in C33A than in HeLa cells .
17: We would also have expected to see similar effects of SF1 and A2 in SiHa cells .
18: In contrast , these data collectively suggest that the effect of A2 on SiHa cell proliferation is at least in part due to an induction of targeted apoptosis .
19: In spite of all of the structural information now available for the RdRp see Supplementary Table 1 , many gaps exist in our understanding of RdRp function .
20: We would like to suggest that dynamics may represent the missing link to our complete understanding of RdRp function Figure 5 .
21: Given the numerous high-resolution structures available for the RdRp in the same and different families , it should be possible to use molecular dynamics MD simulations to determine the extent to which dynamics coevolves with structure and function .
22: Although a high proportion of hyperactivated T cells have been found in COVID-19 subjects , the plasmatic cytokine profile , but not the T cell activation levels , distinguished between non-severe and severe SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects Qin et al. 2020 .
23: Considering the relatively high median age of these patients , it is reasonable to speculate the presence of a low number of epitope-specific nave T cells that could be primed .
24: This suggests that most T lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs are not virus-specific but potentially harmful .
25: Rather , we simply point out that there is an urgent need for a faster and more sensitive test to regulate access to hospitals , including the surgical unit , especially in emergency circumstances .
26: As such , this issue continues to be an open diagnostic problem that affects both patients and health care professionals .
27: Looking at the current diagnosis of COVID-19 , it would appear that both chest CT and LUS have a valuable role to play in the triaging of patients into hospitals , especially in cases of emergency surgery or in situations where surgery can not be procrastinated .
28: In late December 2019 , Chinese health authorities investigated a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases occurring primarily in individuals who had visited a seafood and wet market in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China .
29: Patients reported fever and cough , and most developed chest discomfort andor respiratory distress , with a diagnosis of pneumonia being made by chest radiographs andor computed tomographic CT scan 1 .
30: In addition , SARS-CoV 3CLPro displayed more efficient substrate affinity than MERS-CoV 3CLPro lower Km value Figure 2C .
31: Therefore , we hypothesized that the presence of the turn might transform the secondary structure of the segment and cause the catalytic distinction of the two proteases .
32: The mutant T174 V mutation could increase catalytic activity , which suggested that T174 might dominate the secondary structure of the segment and lead to the significant catalytic distinction of MERS-CoV 3CLPro and SARS-CoV 3CLPro Figures 9E and 9F .
33: This disease was called by us SHF .
34: In a month , 55 rhesus macaques imported from India died .
35: Main manifestations of the infection were hemorrhagic diathesis and damage of neurological status.4 , 5 , 6 Clinical signs were also fever , apathy , anorexia , tremor , ataxia , limb weakness rarely , pareses .
36: Simultaneous determination of serum levels of sLea and disialyl-Lea , and calculation of the sLeadisialyl-Lea ratio provides information useful for excluding a false-positive serum diagnosis .
37: During cancer progression in locally advanced cancers , tumor hypoxia induces transcription of several glyco genes involved in sLea synthesis .
38: Expression of the determinant , consequently , is further accelerated in more malignant hypoxia-resistant cancer cell clones , which become predominant clones in advanced stage cancers and frequently develop hematogenous metastasis .

tensor(0.), 'metadata': 0: We believe that providing initial L-shaped chains such as in CLMM may promote newly built chains to take on such shapes as well .
1: On the other hand , for sparse graphs a well-chosen initial single-qubit chain such as in SPMM can enable short connections to neighboring chains , reducing the qubit footprint of a semi-valid embedding created after the first phase of MinorMiner .
2: We plan to continue extending the approach discussed in this paper and mitigate the mentioned issues .
3: We would like to extend the range of available actions in order to allow the policy to add or remove more virtual machines at once .
4: Furthermore , we aim to modify the system to introduce a continuous policy improvement loop .
5: According to above analysis , cyclopropylamine is suggested to participate in the Xenobiotics Biodegradation Metabolism , which was the 1st-order predicted class for cyclopropylamine by our method .
6: Accordingly , it is quite reasonable to expect that our method may provide useful information for further investigating into biological functions of compounds from the viewpoint of system biology .
7: It appeared that serum levels of sE-selectin are associated with the clinical course of liver metastases from breast cancer .
8: Eichbaum et al. 2004 observed a possible trend for certain unfavorable prognostic parameters e.g. , young women , low-graded tumors , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 over-expression that could be related to higher serum levels of sE-selectin .
9: Moore et al. recently suggested the use of tissue plasminogen activator tPA to treat ARDS in COVID-19 75 .
10: In addition , tackling the systemic prothrombotic complication using anti-inflammatory medications such as anti-IL6R tocilizumab or sarilumab , or the anti-IL6 antibody siltuximab or complement inhibiting strategies to prevent macro- and microthrombi represents another potential approach and several trials are currently verifying this hypothesis 54 .
11: Effective hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be another target to improve the matching of regional perfusion and ventilation in the lung .
12: The proposed emergency needle cricothyrotomy device performed very well .
13: Further work will be pursued in the future with in-vitro and in-vivo with canine models demonstrates the capabilities of the ENCD .
14: Degradation of essential factors for the IFN response can also be achieved by viruses through subversion of ubiquitin pathways that mark a protein for proteosomal degradation by attachment of K48 polyubiquitin chains .
15: In this respect , the STATs appear to be once more attractive targets for viral proteins to direct to proteosomal degradation .
16: Therefore , if the results seen here were due exclusively to innate immunity , we would have expected to see a greater effect in C33A than in HeLa cells .
17: We would also have expected to see similar effects of SF1 and A2 in SiHa cells .
18: In contrast , these data collectively suggest that the effect of A2 on SiHa cell proliferation is at least in part due to an induction of targeted apoptosis .
19: In spite of all of the structural information now available for the RdRp see Supplementary Table 1 , many gaps exist in our understanding of RdRp function .
20: We would like to suggest that dynamics may represent the missing link to our complete understanding of RdRp function Figure 5 .
21: Given the numerous high-resolution structures available for the RdRp in the same and different families , it should be possible to use molecular dynamics MD simulations to determine the extent to which dynamics coevolves with structure and function .
22: Although a high proportion of hyperactivated T cells have been found in COVID-19 subjects , the plasmatic cytokine profile , but not the T cell activation levels , distinguished between non-severe and severe SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects Qin et al. 2020 .
23: Considering the relatively high median age of these patients , it is reasonable to speculate the presence of a low number of epitope-specific nave T cells that could be primed .
24: This suggests that most T lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs are not virus-specific but potentially harmful .
25: Rather , we simply point out that there is an urgent need for a faster and more sensitive test to regulate access to hospitals , including the surgical unit , especially in emergency circumstances .
26: As such , this issue continues to be an open diagnostic problem that affects both patients and health care professionals .
27: Looking at the current diagnosis of COVID-19 , it would appear that both chest CT and LUS have a valuable role to play in the triaging of patients into hospitals , especially in cases of emergency surgery or in situations where surgery can not be procrastinated .
28: In late December 2019 , Chinese health authorities investigated a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases occurring primarily in individuals who had visited a seafood and wet market in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China .
29: Patients reported fever and cough , and most developed chest discomfort andor respiratory distress , with a diagnosis of pneumonia being made by chest radiographs andor computed tomographic CT scan 1 .
30: In addition , SARS-CoV 3CLPro displayed more efficient substrate affinity than MERS-CoV 3CLPro lower Km value Figure 2C .
31: Therefore , we hypothesized that the presence of the turn might transform the secondary structure of the segment and cause the catalytic distinction of the two proteases .
32: The mutant T174 V mutation could increase catalytic activity , which suggested that T174 might dominate the secondary structure of the segment and lead to the significant catalytic distinction of MERS-CoV 3CLPro and SARS-CoV 3CLPro Figures 9E and 9F .
33: This disease was called by us SHF .
34: In a month , 55 rhesus macaques imported from India died .
35: Main manifestations of the infection were hemorrhagic diathesis and damage of neurological status.4 , 5 , 6 Clinical signs were also fever , apathy , anorexia , tremor , ataxia , limb weakness rarely , pareses .
36: Simultaneous determination of serum levels of sLea and disialyl-Lea , and calculation of the sLeadisialyl-Lea ratio provides information useful for excluding a false-positive serum diagnosis .
37: During cancer progression in locally advanced cancers , tumor hypoxia induces transcription of several glyco genes involved in sLea synthesis .
38: Expression of the determinant , consequently , is further accelerated in more malignant hypoxia-resistant cancer cell clones , which become predominant clones in advanced stage cancers and frequently develop hematogenous metastasis .
39: sanguinis have been responsible for rare cases of infectious endocarditis Miyata et al. 2007 Nyawo et al. 2007 Renton et al. 2009 .}
