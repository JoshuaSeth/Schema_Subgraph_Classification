1: Likewise , only a few dsRNA bacteriophages of the family Cystoviridae that infect -proteobacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are currently known Mindich , 2004 although efforts on new virus isolation might expand this range Mantynen et al. , 2015 .
2: The targeted search for extant archaeal RNA viruses so far has netted only a single RNA virus candidate that appears to represent a novel virus family but whose host range remains to be validated Bolduc et al. , 2012 .
3: However , other studies have not found a relationship between circulating ACE and the classical CV risk factors 17 , 31 , 32 .
4: We surmise that the incongruences observed between studies and populations may be ascribed to the effect of RAS blockade on circulating ACE .
5: For ethical reasons , RAS blockade agents were not stopped for the study .
6: Cases of cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients with COVID-19 143,193,194,195 , raising the possibility that myocarditis-related cardiac events may be increased in COVID-19 143,196,197 .
7: Consistent with cardiomyopathy , COVID-19 autopsy reports revealed the presence of a few mononuclear cell infiltrates in the myocardium , presumably recruited from the circulation through inflamed capillaries , but no obvious histological changes in the heart tissue 198 .
8: In 325 cases , thrombi were detected in small epicardial vessels 140 .
9: A biodefense approach addressing the COVID-19 pandemic , biodiversity loss , and climate change crises together could use economic incentives for greening national economies .
10: Investments to support their recovery could include effective responses to climate change rather than supporting fossil fuels especially coal such green investments yield more jobs per dollar invested than do fossil fuel investments and are being embraced by the mayors of large cities in many parts of the world McCormick 2020 .
11: Sepsis and ARDS , including COVID-19 , are characterized by a pro-coagulant state that results in a massive production of thrombin.19 In addition to direct effects on the endothelial barrier by thrombin , the subsequent cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin results in diffuse alveolar and interstitial fibrin deposition yielding the formation of microthrombi.19
12: An important interplay between the innate immune system and platelets occur at the site of endothelial lesions in a mechanism that is upregulated by the effect of thrombin .
13: This mechanistic description underscores an additional potential clinical advantage of direct thrombin inhibitors in ECMO patients afflicted with COVID-19 .
14: While not statistically significant , when analyzed by severity of TBI , we did see that within the severe TBI group , children with AHT had lower rates of extreme CBFV compared with the non-AHT cohort .
15: This is in contrast to our hypothesis and warrants further investigation .
16: Children at risk for repetitive injury may have less of a hyperemic response to an acute traumatic event .
17: Collectively , the present study aims to demonstrate that , following severe cutaneous burn injury , CFTR plays an important role in preventing EBT by inhibiting inflammation and maintaining an intact intestinal epithelial barrier .
18: This study also intends to test whether administration of vitamin D3 is beneficial to the intestine post severe burn .
19: Although exosomal vaccines have been primarily raised interest due to the fact that they allow cross presentation leading to the induction of CD8 T cell responses , the multimeric presentation of viral surface proteins in their natural confirmation might also efficiently trigger viral surface protein-specific B cell receptors , particularly if cellular components of the exosome provide additional stimulatory signals .
20: Since this could also favor the induction of neutralizing antibodies , we explored the potential of SGTM-containing exosomes as a novel vaccine approach against SARS coronavirus infections .
21: Two injections of SGTM-containing xenogenic exosomes without adjuvants were sufficient to induce neutralizing antibody titers .
22: Serological ELISA tests from research laboratories or portfolios of in vitro diagnostic manufacturers may allow a clearer distinction between IgM and IgG kinetics and their respective interest .
23: Nevertheless , the value of these point of care tests seems obvious in countries with limited resources but perhaps also as the epidemic progresses in individuals in the form of self-homemade assay from a drop of blood on the fingertip .
24: This type of test could be easily delivered to individuals and thus limit contact .
25: These results are not congruent with previous studies showing colonization of bacteria in ID badges and lanyards3 , 4 , 5 however , there are certain factors that could explain the difference .
26: In our case , a moderate amount of coccidian was reported in two rabbits .
27: Although tests to differentiate species were not carried out , our findings suggest that moderate to highly pathogenic species affecting the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in this finding , probably acting as complicating factor in the aetiology of diarrhoeas .
28: However , this needs to be confirmed .
29: It is unclear whether continuing NSAIDs is beneficial due to its antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effect in less severe COVID-19 cases .
30: Some advocate acetaminophen use , although it can complicate liver injury as seen in few cases 50 , 51 .
31: In particular , the idea of a portable DNA sequencer coupled to a smartphone Gardy   Loman , 2018 , p. 16 suggests that the individual person   notably absent from current discussions of data sharing in EIDs   could become the relevant unit of reference in disputes . We have already seen above that international disputes can arise from individual actions and have personal consequences such as losing a job , but could individuals themselves claim ownership over samples and data Portable sequencers may liberate genomic data from one , static , laboratory and its norms and values , eliding the movement that causes international disputes , but their use in the field both requires and constitutes the creation of another mobile laboratory   one whose governing norms and values have yet to be established . Our findings may inform development of strategies for prevention of HRV disease and transmission . Moreover , studies are needed to understand host-pathogen interactions across HRV species in different age groups , which will ultimately lead to improved clinical management of severe HRV infection . The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to plan for and implement new strategies to advance our understanding of unmet areas of need in urologic oncology . These can only be answered with attentive trial design and transparent reporting . Currently , there is no serological gold standard for ebolavirus serology .
32: Our results highlight the need for additional research to better understand the roles each protein plays in immune response .
33: Better understanding of the significance of EVD seroreactivity and risk factors associated with these exposures will improve our ability to design and implement locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to ebolavirus and other pathogens .
34: However , it requires contemplation on incremental data with diverse feature sets .
35: The discussed limitations must be considered to enhance the performance of disease prediction models successfully in the presented work .
36: Also , viral loads were only obtained from the upper respiratory tract using nasopharyngeal swabs and at a single time point .
37: While this is the recommended specimen by the CDC , additional synchronous and longitudinal sampling from other sources such as lower respiratory tract and bronchoalveolar lavages in intubated patients would have been important comparator to have .
38: Although dangerous due to technical challenges of specimen collection and increased risk of viral exposure , further exploration of quantitative viral loads from lower respiratory tract tissue and blood in patients exhibiting severe disease may prove to be a better predictor for clinical outcomes .
39: However , few strategies are devoted to how to contain epidemics ., 'predicted_antecedents': tensor([[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,

1: Likewise , only a few dsRNA bacteriophages of the family Cystoviridae that infect -proteobacteria of the genus Pseudomonas are currently known Mindich , 2004 although efforts on new virus isolation might expand this range Mantynen et al. , 2015 .
2: The targeted search for extant archaeal RNA viruses so far has netted only a single RNA virus candidate that appears to represent a novel virus family but whose host range remains to be validated Bolduc et al. , 2012 .
3: However , other studies have not found a relationship between circulating ACE and the classical CV risk factors 17 , 31 , 32 .
4: We surmise that the incongruences observed between studies and populations may be ascribed to the effect of RAS blockade on circulating ACE .
5: For ethical reasons , RAS blockade agents were not stopped for the study .
6: Cases of cardiomyopathy have been reported in patients with COVID-19 143,193,194,195 , raising the possibility that myocarditis-related cardiac events may be increased in COVID-19 143,196,197 .
7: Consistent with cardiomyopathy , COVID-19 autopsy reports revealed the presence of a few mononuclear cell infiltrates in the myocardium , presumably recruited from the circulation through inflamed capillaries , but no obvious histological changes in the heart tissue 198 .
8: In 325 cases , thrombi were detected in small epicardial vessels 140 .
9: A biodefense approach addressing the COVID-19 pandemic , biodiversity loss , and climate change crises together could use economic incentives for greening national economies .
10: Investments to support their recovery could include effective responses to climate change rather than supporting fossil fuels especially coal such green investments yield more jobs per dollar invested than do fossil fuel investments and are being embraced by the mayors of large cities in many parts of the world McCormick 2020 .
11: Sepsis and ARDS , including COVID-19 , are characterized by a pro-coagulant state that results in a massive production of thrombin.19 In addition to direct effects on the endothelial barrier by thrombin , the subsequent cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin results in diffuse alveolar and interstitial fibrin deposition yielding the formation of microthrombi.19
12: An important interplay between the innate immune system and platelets occur at the site of endothelial lesions in a mechanism that is upregulated by the effect of thrombin .
13: This mechanistic description underscores an additional potential clinical advantage of direct thrombin inhibitors in ECMO patients afflicted with COVID-19 .
14: While not statistically significant , when analyzed by severity of TBI , we did see that within the severe TBI group , children with AHT had lower rates of extreme CBFV compared with the non-AHT cohort .
15: This is in contrast to our hypothesis and warrants further investigation .
16: Children at risk for repetitive injury may have less of a hyperemic response to an acute traumatic event .
17: Collectively , the present study aims to demonstrate that , following severe cutaneous burn injury , CFTR plays an important role in preventing EBT by inhibiting inflammation and maintaining an intact intestinal epithelial barrier .
18: This study also intends to test whether administration of vitamin D3 is beneficial to the intestine post severe burn .
19: Although exosomal vaccines have been primarily raised interest due to the fact that they allow cross presentation leading to the induction of CD8 T cell responses , the multimeric presentation of viral surface proteins in their natural confirmation might also efficiently trigger viral surface protein-specific B cell receptors , particularly if cellular components of the exosome provide additional stimulatory signals .
20: Since this could also favor the induction of neutralizing antibodies , we explored the potential of SGTM-containing exosomes as a novel vaccine approach against SARS coronavirus infections .
21: Two injections of SGTM-containing xenogenic exosomes without adjuvants were sufficient to induce neutralizing antibody titers .
22: Serological ELISA tests from research laboratories or portfolios of in vitro diagnostic manufacturers may allow a clearer distinction between IgM and IgG kinetics and their respective interest .
23: Nevertheless , the value of these point of care tests seems obvious in countries with limited resources but perhaps also as the epidemic progresses in individuals in the form of self-homemade assay from a drop of blood on the fingertip .
24: This type of test could be easily delivered to individuals and thus limit contact .
25: These results are not congruent with previous studies showing colonization of bacteria in ID badges and lanyards3 , 4 , 5 however , there are certain factors that could explain the difference .
26: In our case , a moderate amount of coccidian was reported in two rabbits .
27: Although tests to differentiate species were not carried out , our findings suggest that moderate to highly pathogenic species affecting the gastrointestinal tract might have a role in this finding , probably acting as complicating factor in the aetiology of diarrhoeas .
28: However , this needs to be confirmed .
29: It is unclear whether continuing NSAIDs is beneficial due to its antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effect in less severe COVID-19 cases .
30: Some advocate acetaminophen use , although it can complicate liver injury as seen in few cases 50 , 51 .
31: In particular , the idea of a portable DNA sequencer coupled to a smartphone Gardy   Loman , 2018 , p. 16 suggests that the individual person   notably absent from current discussions of data sharing in EIDs   could become the relevant unit of reference in disputes . We have already seen above that international disputes can arise from individual actions and have personal consequences such as losing a job , but could individuals themselves claim ownership over samples and data Portable sequencers may liberate genomic data from one , static , laboratory and its norms and values , eliding the movement that causes international disputes , but their use in the field both requires and constitutes the creation of another mobile laboratory   one whose governing norms and values have yet to be established . Our findings may inform development of strategies for prevention of HRV disease and transmission . Moreover , studies are needed to understand host-pathogen interactions across HRV species in different age groups , which will ultimately lead to improved clinical management of severe HRV infection . The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to plan for and implement new strategies to advance our understanding of unmet areas of need in urologic oncology . These can only be answered with attentive trial design and transparent reporting . Currently , there is no serological gold standard for ebolavirus serology .
32: Our results highlight the need for additional research to better understand the roles each protein plays in immune response .
33: Better understanding of the significance of EVD seroreactivity and risk factors associated with these exposures will improve our ability to design and implement locally sustainable strategies to limit exposure of HCWs to ebolavirus and other pathogens .
34: However , it requires contemplation on incremental data with diverse feature sets .
35: The discussed limitations must be considered to enhance the performance of disease prediction models successfully in the presented work .
36: Also , viral loads were only obtained from the upper respiratory tract using nasopharyngeal swabs and at a single time point .
37: While this is the recommended specimen by the CDC , additional synchronous and longitudinal sampling from other sources such as lower respiratory tract and bronchoalveolar lavages in intubated patients would have been important comparator to have .
38: Although dangerous due to technical challenges of specimen collection and increased risk of viral exposure , further exploration of quantitative viral loads from lower respiratory tract tissue and blood in patients exhibiting severe disease may prove to be a better predictor for clinical outcomes .
39: However , few strategies are devoted to how to contain epidemics .}
